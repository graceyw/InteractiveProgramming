Mini Project 4: Proposal

What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
  We are doing a data visualization project using data on gender equality. Our minimum viable product would be a simple infographic with some minimal interaction between the user and the product (i.e. the user can request a certain kind of data and our program shows it to them). A stretch goal on the other hand, would be a program that allows the user to view, manipulate, compare and contrast data.

What are your learning goals for this project (for each member)?
  Gracey’s Learning Goals: to practice taking a hands-on approach and not taking a back-seat role to the coding even when partner has more experience than I and to learn how to work on a programming project with a partner (i.e. navigating Github with pulling and pushing, etc.)
  Noah’s Learning Goals: to practice working on a programming project with a partner (past programming projects have typically been solo endeavors)

What libraries are you planning to use? (if you don’t know enough yet, please outline how you will decide this question during the beginning phase of the project).
  We will get our data from the International Monetary Fund.

What do you plan to accomplish by the mid-project check-in?
  By mid-project check-ins we aim to have a clear implementation plan including what work is expected of each partner going forward. Additionally we would like to have made reasonable progress on the project as a whole and potentially even have an operational MVP.

What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project?
  We see two main potential threats to our success in this project:
    1) The discrepancy in experience levels between team members, and
    2) The limited resources of time and energy we will be able to commit to the project.
  We plan to mitigate these risks by not only maximizing the skills each partner brings to the team, but also making a conscious effort to support the learning goals of each individual. Additionally, we have already discussed the amount of time we are willing to commit to this project, and we will continue having regular check-ins about our expectations of each other and our subsequent comfort levels with those expectations.
